Keep developpement chart:
	- naming convention is Camel case
	- use '_' only in private fields and constants;
	- private fields startwuth m_[UpperCase];
	- local variable starts with [LowerCase];
	- properties and functions starts with [UpperCase];
	- generic attribut must be named with explicite name ([TKey, TValue] instead of [T, U]
	- use var type only for Linq or Anonyme class.

	Move all OS specific instructions (like file access..) to specific project who expose interface (Pattern gof) that implement game interface (class inheritance) use with game process to exchange informations.
